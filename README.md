# MÃ©thode

*Reproducing results*
Code from Fergus is included in ssl_eigenfunctions, along with some scripts to run the code on 
the dataset.

*SSL via HFS with LSH*
do_lsh.py is our main file for computing the HFS solution. It needs a numpy saved file 
containing the dimensionality reduced gist features for the tiny image dataset.
